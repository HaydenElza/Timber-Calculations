# Timber-Analysis

Python Script that takes in multiple formats of databases of timber inventory and sorts the data based
on attributes and calculations within the script.  This script has forest managers and agencies in mind
in that it simplifies the process of data crunching after data has been provided or obtained in the field.

If you are interested in using the script please feel free to fork the respository and use the example
dataset we have uploaded to test it.  If you have any additions or comments please follow the general
guidelines on github in doing so.  We are working hard to create reliable scripts that can encompass
multiple forestry environments and mangement goals.


Thank you
